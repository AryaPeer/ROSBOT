# ROSBOT

A ROS2 bot that can use SLAM (NAV2, AMCL or Slam_Toolbox (based on LIDAR)) to navigate around obstacles and can use a camera to track or move towards an object (using OpenCV).

Config holds the configuration of nodes, description holds the xacro files for rednering the robot, launch holds the launch files, and the worlds folder only has an empty world in it currently as I forgot to save my gazebo world.
